# Mastering Arduino
This is the code repository for [Mastering Arduino](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/mastering-arduino?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788830584), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Mastering Arduino is a practical, no-nonsense guide teaching you the electronics and programming skills that you need to create advanced Arduino projects. It is packed full of real-world projects leading up to the final project where you will build and control a basic robot.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 9.



The code will look like the following:
```
#define BUTTON_ONE 12
#define LED_ONE 11

void setup() {
  pinMode(BUTTON_ONE, INPUT);
  pinMode(LED_ONE, OUTPUT);
}
```
